## CS 344 Operating Systems I Project: Create a shell in C

### **Objectives:**
To be able to describe the ***Unix process*** and write a program using 
the ***Unix process API***. Practice utilizing ***signals, signal handling, 
and I/O redirection***.

### **Issues & Results:**
I under estimated how much I would learn from completing this project.
While understanding the Unix process, signal, and signal handling
were vital for completion, I found great value in many of the
other functions required to succeed with this project. Specifically,
expanding variables and manually exiting the shell. Writing the functionality 
for both of these procedures were reminders of how much we take for granted
when using libraries and packags. Overall, this program was great 
for emphasizing the need to understand how programs function under the hood
to better improve overall functionality.



*Please feel free to run by using the included Makefile and test by placing p3testscript 
in the same directory as the shell program and running via ./p3testscript 2>&1. Any 
feedback is welcomed and greatly appreciated.*
